# Presentation Schedule

The presentation will take place in room S-115 in Kitty Kjellands hus (KK).
The room is downstairs below the campus book store.

Before your session, please make sure that you have your presentation files committed and pushed to your group's repository for easy access.
Demo videos should be uploaded to YouTube as unlisted videos, and the link should be shared with us in the `lab6/README.md` file of your repository.

Please arrive 10 minutes before your session starts so that we can load the presentation files onto a single computer, to reduce switching time.
We can show PowerPoint or PDF on the computer in the room.
If your presenting with Keynote on macOS, please let us know before the session so that we can organize switching with the least amount of friction.

Reminder: all participants of groups listed in each session is expected to attend the whole session.
Participants are free to attend other sessions as well.

The presentation session is pass/fail.
The intention is to examine whether or not you are the authors of the project you are presenting.
We are not looking to fail anyone, but we don't accept cheating.
You should do the best you can to present the work.
It is the report that decides the pass/fail of the course.
You should think of the presentation as a mandatory assignment necessary to pass.
