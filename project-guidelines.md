# Project Selection Guidelines

Welcome to the project selection guidelines for creating an application for
testing deployment using cloud technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EC2,
and S3. Below are the project options you can choose from. Select an option
that aligns with your skills and interests.

## 1. Web-Based Application

Choose a web-based application that offers a user interface accessible through
a web browser. This could encompass a basic website, a blog, a content management
system (CMS), a web app, or even a streaming platform.

## 2. Single-Component Application

Opt for an application that revolves around a single main component. This implies
that the core functionality of the application resides within a solitary component,
simplifying deployment and management.

## 3. Stateless Application

Consider a stateless application where each incoming request can be handled
independently, without relying on prior interactions. This is commonly seen in web
applications that store session data separately in databases or caches.

## 4. Stateful Application

For those seeking a more intricate challenge, a stateful application can be chosen.
This type of application maintains context across interactions, such as a
database-backed web application, a gaming platform, or a chat application.

## Specific Project Ideas

### 1. Web Blog Platform

Create a web-based blog platform where users can publish articles, comment on posts,
and interact with other users.

Opt for a web-based blog platform like WordPress. It’s a single-component,
stateless application that can be effortlessly deployed using Docker, Kubernetes,
and AWS services.

### 2. Simple E-commerce Site

Choose to develop a basic e-commerce website. This single-component, stateless
application can involve tasks like showcasing products, adding them to a cart, and
facilitating the checkout process.

### 3. Static Website with Contact Form

Create a static website featuring a contact form. This simple stateless application
involves hosting a contact form that triggers email notifications upon submission.

### 4. Streaming Application

Take on the challenge of building a streaming platform where users can watch live or
recorded content. This stateful application involves managing media files and facilitating
real-time streaming capabilities.

### 5. Gaming Platform

For a more advanced project, consider developing a gaming platform. This stateful
application requires managing user profiles, game states, and real-time interactions
between players.

## Conclusion

When deciding on your project, consider your skill level, interests, and the level of
complexity you’re comfortable with. Each of these options provides an opportunity to explore
cloud technologies and their deployment intricacies.

Happy coding!
